### Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports

**Table: Employee**

```plaintext
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| department  | varchar |
| managerId   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
```

- `id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
- Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the id of their manager.
- If `managerId` is null, then the employee does not have a manager.
- No employee will be the manager of themself.

Write a solution to find managers with at least five direct reports.

Return the result table in any order.

### Example

#### Input:

**Employee table:**

```plaintext
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
| id  | name  | department | managerId |
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
| 101 | John  | A          | null      |
| 102 | Dan   | A          | 101       |
| 103 | James | A          | 101       |
| 104 | Amy   | A          | 101       |
| 105 | Anne  | A          | 101       |
| 106 | Ron   | B          | 101       |
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
+------+
| name |
+------+
| John |
+------+
```

### Explanation:
- John (id: 101) is the manager of 5 employees: Dan, James, Amy, Anne, and Ron.
- Since John has at least 5 direct reports, he is included in the result.

### Thought Process:
1. **Understand the Problem**: Identify managers who directly supervise 5 or more employees.
2. **Key Relationships**:
   - Use the `managerId` column to establish the relationship between employees and their managers.
   - Group employees by `managerId` to count the number of direct reports for each manager.
3. **Filter**:
   - Use `HAVING` to filter managers with 5 or more direct reports.
4. **Join**:
   - Join the resulting manager IDs with the `Employee` table to retrieve their names.
5. **Return the Result**:
   - Output the names of managers who qualify.

### Query:

```sql
SELECT name 
FROM Employee 
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT managerId 
    FROM Employee 
    GROUP BY managerId 
    HAVING COUNT(managerId) >= 5
);
```

---

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Subquery**:
   - `SELECT managerId FROM Employee GROUP BY managerId HAVING COUNT(managerId) >= 5`
     - Groups employees by `managerId` and counts the number of direct reports for each manager.
     - Filters for managers with at least 5 direct reports using the `HAVING` clause.
2. **Main Query**:
   - `SELECT name FROM Employee WHERE id IN (...)`
     - Retrieves the names of managers whose `id` matches the `managerId` from the subquery.
3. **Final Output**:
   - Outputs the names of managers with at least 5 direct reports.

---

### Why it Works:
- The subquery identifies eligible managers based on their `managerId`.
- The main query matches these `managerId`s with the corresponding `id` to fetch the manager names.
- The result is ordered as requested and includes only managers meeting the criteria.
