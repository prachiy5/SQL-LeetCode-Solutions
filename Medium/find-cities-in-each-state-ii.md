# Problem Description

You are given a table `cities` with the following structure:

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| state       | varchar |
| city        | varchar |

- `(state, city)` is the combination of columns with unique values for this table.
- Each row contains the state name and the city name within that state.

### Task
Find all the cities in each state and analyze them based on the following requirements:

1. Combine all cities into a comma-separated string for each state.
2. Only include states that have at least 3 cities.
3. Only include states where at least one city starts with the same letter as the state name.
4. Return the result table ordered by:
   - The count of matching-letter cities in descending order.
   - State name in ascending order (alphabetically).

### Input Example
#### cities Table:

| state        | city          |
|--------------|---------------|
| New York     | New York City |
| New York     | Newark        |
| New York     | Buffalo       |
| New York     | Rochester     |
| California   | San Francisco |
| California   | Sacramento    |
| California   | San Diego     |
| California   | Los Angeles   |
| Texas        | Tyler         |
| Texas        | Temple        |
| Texas        | Taylor        |
| Texas        | Dallas        |
| Pennsylvania | Philadelphia  |
| Pennsylvania | Pittsburgh    |
| Pennsylvania | Pottstown     |

### Output Example

| state       | cities                                    | matching_letter_count |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Pennsylvania| Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Pottstown       | 3                     |
| Texas       | Dallas, Taylor, Temple, Tyler             | 3                     |
| New York    | Buffalo, Newark, New York City, Rochester | 2                     |

### Explanation

- **Pennsylvania**:
  - Has 3 cities (meets minimum requirement).
  - All 3 cities start with 'P' (same as state).
  - `matching_letter_count = 3`.

- **Texas**:
  - Has 4 cities (meets minimum requirement).
  - 3 cities (Taylor, Temple, Tyler) start with 'T' (same as state).
  - `matching_letter_count = 3`.

- **New York**:
  - Has 4 cities (meets minimum requirement).
  - 2 cities (Newark, New York City) start with 'N' (same as state).
  - `matching_letter_count = 2`.

- **California**:
  - Has 4 cities (meets minimum requirement).
  - No cities start with 'C' (doesn't meet the matching letter requirement).

### Thought Process

1. **Filter States with at Least 3 Cities**:
   - Use `GROUP BY` to count the cities for each state.
   - Include only states where the count of cities is greater than or equal to 3.

2. **Count Matching-Letter Cities**:
   - Use `CASE` to check if the first letter of the state matches the first letter of a city.
   - Sum these matches to calculate the `matching_letter_count` for each state.

3. **Combine City Names**:
   - Use `GROUP_CONCAT` to create a comma-separated string of city names for each state.
   - Sort city names alphabetically within the string.

4. **Filter by Matching-Letter Count**:
   - Include only states where `matching_letter_count > 0`.

5. **Order the Results**:
   - Sort by `matching_letter_count` in descending order.
   - If counts are equal, sort by state name alphabetically.

### Query
```sql
SELECT 
    state, 
    GROUP_CONCAT(city ORDER BY city SEPARATOR ', ') AS cities,
    SUM(CASE WHEN LEFT(state, 1) = LEFT(city, 1) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matching_letter_count
FROM 
    cities
GROUP BY 
    state
HAVING 
    COUNT(city) >= 3 
    AND matching_letter_count > 0
ORDER BY 
    matching_letter_count DESC, 
    state;
