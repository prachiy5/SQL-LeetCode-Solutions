### Calculate Parking Fees and Duration

We are tasked with analyzing parking transactions to calculate the following metrics for each car:

1. **Total Fee Paid**: The sum of all fees paid by the car across all parking lots.
2. **Average Hourly Fee**: The total fees divided by the total time spent in parking (rounded to 2 decimal places).
3. **Most Time Spent Lot**: The parking lot where the car spent the most time (calculated as the sum of all durations in that lot).

The result should be ordered by `car_id` in ascending order.

### Example Input and Output

#### Input:

**ParkingTransactions table:**

| lot_id | car_id | entry_time          | exit_time           | fee_paid |
|--------|--------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|
| 1      | 1001   | 2023-06-01 08:00:00 | 2023-06-01 10:30:00 | 5.00     |
| 1      | 1001   | 2023-06-02 11:00:00 | 2023-06-02 12:45:00 | 3.00     |
| 2      | 1001   | 2023-06-01 10:45:00 | 2023-06-01 12:00:00 | 6.00     |
| 2      | 1002   | 2023-06-01 09:00:00 | 2023-06-01 11:30:00 | 4.00     |
| 3      | 1001   | 2023-06-03 07:00:00 | 2023-06-03 09:00:00 | 4.00     |
| 3      | 1002   | 2023-06-02 12:00:00 | 2023-06-02 14:00:00 | 2.00     |

#### Output:

| car_id | total_fee_paid | avg_hourly_fee | most_time_lot |
|--------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1001   | 18.00          | 2.40           | 1             |
| 1002   | 6.00           | 1.33           | 2             |

#### Explanation:
- **Total Fee Paid**: Calculated as the sum of all `fee_paid` for each car.
- **Average Hourly Fee**: Total fees divided by the total time spent across all parking lots.
- **Most Time Spent Lot**: The parking lot where the car spent the most time, calculated using the difference between `entry_time` and `exit_time`.

### Thought Process
1. **Step 1**: Calculate total fees and total time spent for each car.
   - Group by `car_id` and aggregate `fee_paid` and the duration (in hours) calculated using `TIMESTAMPDIFF`.
2. **Step 2**: Calculate the average hourly fee.
   - Divide total fees by total time spent and round to 2 decimal places.
3. **Step 3**: Determine the lot where each car spent the most time.
   - Group by `car_id` and `lot_id` and calculate the total time spent per lot.
   - Use `DENSE_RANK` to find the lot with the maximum time spent for each car.
4. **Step 4**: Combine results.
   - Join the tables from previous steps and filter for the most time spent lot.
