### Shortest Distance in a Plane

**Table: Point2D**

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| x           | int  |
| y           | int  |

(x, y) is the primary key column (combination of columns with unique values) for this table. Each row of this table indicates the position of a point on the X-Y plane.

The distance between two points `p1(x1, y1)` and `p2(x2, y2)` is calculated as:

```
sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
```

Write a solution to report the shortest distance between any two points from the Point2D table. Round the distance to two decimal points.

### Example:

#### Input: 

**Point2D table:**

| x  | y  |
|----|----|
| -1 | -1 |
| 0  | 0  |
| -1 | -2 |

#### Output: 

| shortest |
|----------|
| 1.00     |

#### Explanation: 
The shortest distance is `1.00` from point `(-1, -1)` to `(-1, -2)`.

### Thought Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to calculate the shortest distance between any two points in the table.
   - This involves comparing all pairs of points and finding the minimum distance.

2. **Distance Formula**:
   - Use the Euclidean distance formula: `sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)`.

3. **Approach**:
   - Create a self-join of the `Point2D` table to compare all pairs of points.
   - Use a condition to ensure each pair is considered only once by comparing row numbers.
   - Calculate the distance for each pair.
   - Find the minimum distance.

4. **Optimization**:
   - Use `row_number()` to assign unique row numbers to each point and filter pairs to avoid redundancy.
   - Use `POWER` to compute squares and `SQRT` for the square root.
   - Round the result to two decimal points.

### Query:

```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT *,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER () AS rn 
    FROM Point2D
)
SELECT ROUND(
           SQRT(
               MIN(POWER((c1.x - c2.x), 2) + POWER((c1.y - c2.y), 2))
           ), 2
       ) AS shortest
FROM cte c1
INNER JOIN cte c2
ON c1.rn > c2.rn;
```

---

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **Generate Row Numbers**:
   - `ROW_NUMBER()` assigns a unique number to each row, allowing us to uniquely identify points.

2. **Self-Join**:
   - The table is joined to itself (`cte c1` and `cte c2`) to compare every pair of points.
   - The condition `c1.rn > c2.rn` ensures that each pair is considered only once.

3. **Calculate Distance**:
   - For each pair of points `(c1.x, c1.y)` and `(c2.x, c2.y)`, compute the distance using the formula:
     ```
     sqrt((c1.x - c2.x)^2 + (c1.y - c2.y)^2)
     ```

4. **Find Minimum Distance**:
   - Use `MIN` to find the smallest distance among all pairs.

5. **Round the Result**:
   - Use `ROUND` to round the final result to two decimal places.

6. **Return the Shortest Distance**:
   - The shortest distance is returned as a single row in the result table.

### Output:

For the input example, the query outputs:

| shortest |
|----------|
| 1.00     |
