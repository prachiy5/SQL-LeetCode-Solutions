### Problem Description

We have an `Employee` table where each row contains the `employee_id` and their corresponding `team_id`. Our task is to determine the team size for each employee and return a result table that includes `employee_id` and `team_size` for all employees. The result can be returned in any order.

### Example Walkthrough

**Input Table:**

| employee_id | team_id |
|-------------|---------|
| 1           | 8       |
| 2           | 8       |
| 3           | 8       |
| 4           | 7       |
| 5           | 9       |
| 6           | 9       |

**Query Execution:**

- For `team_id = 8`: Employees 1, 2, 3 belong to this team, so `team_size = 3`.
- For `team_id = 7`: Only employee 4 belongs to this team, so `team_size = 1`.
- For `team_id = 9`: Employees 5 and 6 belong to this team, so `team_size = 2`.

**Output Table:**

| employee_id | team_size |
|-------------|-----------|
| 1           | 3         |
| 2           | 3         |
| 3           | 3         |
| 4           | 1         |
| 5           | 2         |
| 6           | 2         |

### Thought Process

1. **Understand the Team Size**:
   - Each employee belongs to a team identified by `team_id`.
   - The team size is the total number of employees in a team.

2. **Window Functions**:
   - To calculate the team size for each employee, we can use the `COUNT(*)` function as a window function.
   - Use `PARTITION BY team_id` to group employees by their respective teams while maintaining the granularity of individual rows.

3. **Output Requirements**:
   - Include `employee_id` and `team_size` in the output.
   - Sort the result by `employee_id` to make it consistent.

4. **Final Query**:
   - Use the `COUNT(*) OVER` clause to calculate the team size for each employee.
   - Ensure the query outputs the desired columns in the required format.

### Query

```sql
SELECT employee_id,
       COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY team_id) AS team_size
FROM Employee
ORDER BY employee_id;
```

---

### Explanation

1. **Window Function**:
   - `COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY team_id)` calculates the number of employees in each team by grouping rows based on `team_id`.
   - This gives the same team size for all employees within the same team.

2. **Result Columns**:
   - `employee_id`: Directly selected from the table.
   - `team_size`: Computed dynamically for each employee using the window function.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The `ORDER BY employee_id` ensures the output is sorted by `employee_id`.

### Summary

This query uses a window function to efficiently calculate team sizes for each employee. By leveraging `PARTITION BY`, we group employees by their `team_id` and compute the size of each team. The result is sorted by `employee_id` for clarity and consistency.
