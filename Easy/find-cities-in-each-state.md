### Find Cities in Each State

#### Table: `cities`

```plaintext
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| state       | varchar |
| city        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
```

- `(state, city)` is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
- Each row of this table contains the state name and the city name within that state.

Write a solution to find all the cities in each state and combine them into a single comma-separated string.

Return the result table ordered by `state` and `city` in ascending order.

The result format is shown in the following example.

### Example:

#### Input:

`cities` table:

```plaintext
+-------------+---------------+
| state       | city          |
+-------------+---------------+
| California  | Los Angeles   |
| California  | San Francisco |
| California  | San Diego     |
| Texas       | Houston       |
| Texas       | Austin        |
| Texas       | Dallas        |
| New York    | New York City |
| New York    | Buffalo       |
| New York    | Rochester     |
+-------------+---------------+
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
+-------------+---------------------------------------+
| state       | cities                                |
+-------------+---------------------------------------+
| California  | Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco |
| New York    | Buffalo, New York City, Rochester     |
| Texas       | Austin, Dallas, Houston               |
+-------------+---------------------------------------+
```

#### Explanation:

- **California**: All cities ("Los Angeles", "San Diego", "San Francisco") are listed in a comma-separated string.
- **New York**: All cities ("Buffalo", "New York City", "Rochester") are listed in a comma-separated string.
- **Texas**: All cities ("Austin", "Dallas", "Houston") are listed in a comma-separated string.
- The output table is ordered by the `state` name in ascending order.

### Thought Process:

1. **Understand the Requirement**:
   - Combine all city names in each state into a single string, separated by commas.
   - The cities in each string should be sorted alphabetically.

2. **Key Points**:
   - Use the `GROUP BY` clause to group data by `state`.
   - Use the `GROUP_CONCAT` function to concatenate the city names.
   - Sort the concatenated city names in ascending order using `ORDER BY` within `GROUP_CONCAT`.

3. **Approach**:
   - Use `GROUP_CONCAT(city ORDER BY city ASC SEPARATOR ', ')` to generate a comma-separated list of cities for each state.
   - Group the query by `state`.
   - Order the results by `state` in ascending order.

---

### Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    state,
    GROUP_CONCAT(city ORDER BY city ASC SEPARATOR ', ') AS cities
FROM 
    cities
GROUP BY 
    state;
```

---

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **Grouping by State**:
   - `GROUP BY state` ensures that all cities within the same state are grouped together.

2. **Concatenating Cities**:
   - `GROUP_CONCAT(city ORDER BY city ASC SEPARATOR ', ')`:
     - `ORDER BY city ASC` ensures the cities are alphabetically ordered within each group.
     - `SEPARATOR ', '` specifies that the cities in the resulting string are separated by a comma and a space.

3. **Sorting the Result**:
   - The query result is naturally sorted by `state` due to the `GROUP BY` clause.

---

### Why this Works:

- The `GROUP_CONCAT` function is ideal for combining multiple values into a single string.
- The query groups cities by state, orders them alphabetically, and concatenates them into a single string, meeting all requirements of the problem.

---

### Output:

Given the input example, this query will produce:

```plaintext
+-------------+---------------------------------------+
| state       | cities                                |
+-------------+---------------------------------------+
| California  | Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco |
| New York    | Buffalo, New York City, Rochester     |
| Texas       | Austin, Dallas, Houston               |
+-------------+---------------------------------------+
