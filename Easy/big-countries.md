# Big Countries 

### Problem

#### Table: World

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| name        | varchar |
| continent   | varchar |
| area        | int     |
| population  | int     |
| gdp         | bigint  |

- `name` is the primary key column with unique values.
- Each row gives information about the name of a country, its continent, area, population, and GDP value.

#### Task
A country is considered **big** if:

1. It has an area of at least three million (`3000000 km²`), or
2. It has a population of at least twenty-five million (`25000000`).

Write a solution to find the `name`, `population`, and `area` of the big countries.

Return the result table in any order.

#### Example

**Input:**

`World` table:

| name        | continent | area    | population | gdp          |
|-------------|-----------|---------|------------|--------------|
| Afghanistan | Asia      | 652230  | 25500100   | 20343000000  |
| Albania     | Europe    | 28748   | 2831741    | 12960000000  |
| Algeria     | Africa    | 2381741 | 37100000   | 188681000000 |
| Andorra     | Europe    | 468     | 78115      | 3712000000   |
| Angola      | Africa    | 1246700 | 20609294   | 100990000000 |

**Output:**

| name        | population | area    |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| Afghanistan | 25500100   | 652230  |
| Algeria     | 37100000   | 2381741 |

**Explanation:**
- Afghanistan qualifies because its population is greater than 25 million.
- Algeria qualifies because its population is greater than 25 million.
- Albania, Andorra, and Angola do not meet either condition.

### Thought Process

To solve this problem, the goal is to filter the `World` table to find countries that qualify as **big** based on the given conditions. Here’s how I approached it step by step:

1. **Understand the Conditions:**
   - A country qualifies if its `area` is at least 3 million or its `population` is at least 25 million.

2. **Filter Rows Based on Conditions:**
   - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter rows where:
     - `area >= 3000000`, or
     - `population >= 25000000`.

3. **Select Relevant Columns:**
   - Return the `name`, `population`, and `area` of the filtered rows.

4. **Order of Results:**
   - The result can be returned in any order as the problem does not specify sorting.

### Solution

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT name, population, area
FROM World 
WHERE area >= 3000000
   OR population >= 25000000;
```

---

### Solution Explanation

- **WHERE Clause:**
  - Filters rows where `area` is at least 3 million or `population` is at least 25 million.
- **SELECT Statement:**
  - Retrieves the `name`, `population`, and `area` columns for the filtered rows.

### Key Takeaways

- **Logical Operators (`OR`):** Use `OR` to combine multiple conditions in the `WHERE` clause.
- **Filtering Rows:** The `WHERE` clause ensures only rows meeting at least one of the conditions are included.
- **Selecting Specific Columns:** Always select only the required columns to keep the output clean and relevant.
